# SOEN341 Career Services Application

The objective of this project is to provide a career services platform where the students
(people looking for jobs) will be able to post and update their portfolio and the employers
should be able to post jobs. With the help of this, you can carry out a job head hunting in your
own comfort. This benefits job-seeking candidates and employers to shortlist their potential job
and employee respectively. This can also help employers find specific candidates as per their
requirements along with job seekers being able to tailor their profile as per the market. All you
require is a PC or a mobile device with Internet to access the website online. To get to this online
career services system all the Students and Employers will create an account, and use their
email and password to log in. Students will create/modify their profiles and will view and apply
to job postings. Employers will create and manage their job posts, and review applications from
candidates. The login credentials for this system are under high security and nobody will have
the capacity to crack it easily. Employers will receive notifications when students apply to their
job offers, and students when they are called for an interview.
